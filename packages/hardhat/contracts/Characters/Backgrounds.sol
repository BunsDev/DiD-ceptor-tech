/* experimental smart contract by Tippi Fifestarr for Ceptor Games
/  simply provide an on-chain querable array of public domain random backstory
/  other smart contracts can import this or an interface of it to get a backstory
/  if that contract has a source verifiable of randomness, thats very cool
/  Ideally, this can be upgraded to request a functions call from the Gateway
