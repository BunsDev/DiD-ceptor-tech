## Games Team

**Gaozong:** Our UX / PM, superstar

**Tippi:** Smart Contracts and GM

**Verinta:** The Qwizzler, frontend and even a smart contract too!

Ceptor-Scaffold-OP is a fork of Scaffold-ETH2 with fantastic differences, providing additional dApp examples, native support for Superchain testnets, and more low-level instructions. We highly recommend the Scaffold-ETH2 docs as the primary guideline. 

# Games Contracts

### [Game World Generator](BuyMeACeptor.sol)
Step into the realms of creativity with our Game World Generator. This contract spawns a unique game world, sculpted by your chosen vibe and number of players. Picture a planet alive with scenarios, locations, descriptions, maps, denizens, secrets, goals, and players. Each world, distinct and thriving on its own blockchain, is birthed for 10 gameTokens. Craft your world, or join the adventure: 5 gT as a GM, 2 gT as a player.

**Inside worlds:**
- Games: Rich with adventure.
- Schedules: Timed meticulously.
- Sessions: Verified attendance.

### [Character Generator](packages/hardhat/contracts/CeptorCharacterGenerator.sol)
Unleash your avatar in the game world. This contract creates characters with abilities, class, name, alignment, and background. Each character boasts unique attributes. Note: Currently restricted to contract owner, slated for VRF2.5 upgrade.

### [World and Game Management](packages/hardhat/contracts/WorldFactory.sol)
The World Generator deploys a World contract. Each World tracks its games, ensuring verifiable truth within sessions.

### [NPC Generator]
Forge the world‚Äôs inhabitants. The NPC Generator creates non-player characters, each with unique abilities, class, name, alignment, hometown, and background. This, too, is destined for the VRF2.5 upgrade.

Crafted with the prowess of a Level 5 Barbarian, the ingenuity of an Artificer 2, and the cosmic insight of a Druid of the Stars 2, by Tippi Fifestarr.

üß™ An open-source, up-to-date toolkit for building decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It's designed to make it easier for developers to create and deploy smart contracts and build user interfaces that interact with those contracts.

‚öôÔ∏è Built using NextJS, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript.

- ‚úÖ **Contract Hot Reload**: Your frontend auto-adapts to your smart contract as you edit it.
- ü™ù **[Custom hooks](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/)**: Collection of React hooks wrapper around [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to simplify interactions with smart contracts with typescript autocompletion.
- üß± [**Components**](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/components/): Collection of common web3 components to quickly build your frontend.
- üî• **Burner Wallet & Local Faucet**: Quickly test your application with a burner wallet and local faucet.
- üîê **Integration with Wallet Providers**: Connect to different wallet providers and interact with the Ethereum network.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-OP, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/scaffold-op.git
cd scaffold-op
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On the same terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

Run smart contract test with `yarn hardhat:test`

- Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit your frontend in `packages/nextjs/pages`
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

## Deploy Contracts to Superchain Testnet(s)

To deploy contracts to a remote testnet (e.g. Optimism Sepolia), follow the steps below:

1. Get Superchain Sepolia ETH from the [Superchain Faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet)

2. Inside the `packages/hardhat` directory, copy `.env.example` to `.env`.

   ```bash
   cd packages/hardhat && cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Edit your `.env` to specify the environment variables. Only specifying the `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` is necessary here. The contract will be deployed from the address associated with this private key, so make sure it has enough Sepolia ETH.

   ```bash
   DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY = "your_private_key_with_sepolia_ETH";
   ```

4. Inside `scaffold-op`, run

   ```bash
   yarn deploy --network-options
   ```

   Use spacebar to make your selection(s). This command deploys all smart contracts in `packages/hardhat/contracts` to the selected network(s). Alternatively, you can try

   ```bash
   yarn deploy --network networkName
   ```

   Network names are found in `hardhat.config.js`. Please ensure you have enough Sepolia ETH on all these Superchains. If the deployments are successful, you will see the deployment tx hash on the terminal.

## Adding Foundry

Hardhat's NodeJS stack and cleaner deployment management makes it a better default for Scaffold-OP.

To add Foundry to Scaffold-OP, follow this simple [tutorial](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/advanced/hardhat-and-foundry) by Hardhat. We recommend users who want more robust and faster testing to add Foundry.

## Documentation

We highly recommend visiting the original [docs](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io) to learn how to start building with Scaffold-ETH 2.
